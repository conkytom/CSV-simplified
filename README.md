# CSV-simplified
### A CSV viewer and editor to allow users to search, sort, merge, and more with a graphical interface. 

The goal of this project is create a simple, intuitive, graphical interface that allows the user to view and interact with a CSV and provide them with tools to manipulate the data.  While the project is inteded to help developers it should also be clear and helpful enough that anyone can pick it up easily.

The tools that CSV-simplified aims to create includes:
  - Open 
  - View 
  - Save
  - Search: find a particular value
  - Query: find and return a range of values based on certain parameters
  - Merge: combine 2 or more CSVs that contain shared data
  - Find Duplicates: finds duplicate entries or values within the csv
  - Find Anamolies: finds entries that have more or fewer values than other entries, or are not the same data type
